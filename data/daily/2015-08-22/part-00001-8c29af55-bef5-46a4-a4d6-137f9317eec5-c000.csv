Got this last Christmas along with the PDP yoshi one. I was a bit bummed out that they're basically Wii classic controllers rather than gamecube controllers meaning i have to plug them into a Wiimote. The original descriptions didn't note that when they came out and I thought that I'd buy a few since I had bought the Special edition of Smash bros Wii U with the 4 port Gamecube adapter. Other than that it works great. If you're on the fence between the Hori and PDP, I can tell you the Hori is more comfortable for me since I have larger hands. It's basically the same shape as the original Gamecube controllers. The PDP ones remind me of the pelican controllers for the Gamecube (I'm almost positive its the same mold), they're not quite as wide as the original and I also hit the shoulder R button when I'm trying to press the R trigger on the PDP sometimes, not so on the Hori. Great product, Hori has always been good for 3rd party controllers.	2015-08-22

As a woman I enjoy games that aren't all about using weapons all of the time. They seem mindless and I get bored quickly. But when a game combines using your intellect along with a mastery of weapons can be a challenge. Then bringing in a book/show that I love (GOT) as a tie-in is even better. I know how to use various weapons in real life, so it's not a case of not approving of them. But I like using my brain too which is why this game along with others like it such as &#34;Life is Strange&#34; and &#34;The Wolf among us&#34; are infinitely more enjoyable than mindless killing. By the way I am in my 50's so that probably surprises gamers as well as the creators.	2015-08-22

US	10016584	RLOLJZSTNXUU	B007W8S2MG	952921136	Persona 4 Golden - PlayStation Vita	Video Games	5	13	13	N	N	One of the absolute best games I've ever played in my entire freakin life. Seriously.	I pulled over 125 hours of solid gameplay with this one. I played it every day for weeks, day and night, whenever I had free time. You can say that I was addicted, because I WAS--I couldn't put this game down. It is one of my all-time favorite games. I bought it on a whim; I got my Vita cause, why not get one? I needed games for it, got a few random ones, including P4:G. At that point, I'd never played a Persona game in my life, I had no idea what the games were like, either. I wasn't a fan of turn based combat and &#34;comic booky&#34; like dialogue--I was used to a lot of fluid motion and action, like Kingdom Hearts sorta. This game was entirely different for me, and changed my gaming life forever!! It opened so many doors and gave me such a broader array of games to enjoy! I will honestly say that this game was more than a game, it was an EXPERIENCE. An experience full of tears, racing heartbeats, sweaty hands, head scratching, cursing, laughing, embarrassment and shock: I LIVED in this game.<br /><br />The story: 10/10. Without going into much detail, the story is incredibly dynamic and in a way, realistic. Of course the evens that happened in the game could probably never happen for real, but it was REAL in the game. I actually felt scared for the city, and scared for the people. You get this sense of dread and being trapped and having to delve deep within yourself to pull out the hero inside, and save everyone. The game hurts, it can hurt you emotionally--you deeply feel for everyone involved. A spoiler free synopsis is that people are being killed mysteriously. You've got to go to another world to uncover the truths about the murders and disappearances before it's too late. And that's exactly what you'll be driven to do, too! And at the same time, you've got to balance saving the world with being student--studying, building skills, etc. You can have jobs, hobbies, and most importantly, you've got to build up your social skills and make new friends. This was alesson in real life for me as I ironically shut myself in all day to play this game, I realized that I need to actually work on my real life as hard as I work on my life in the game! See I told you: this game is an experience.<br /><br />The characters: 11/10. The story follows eight heroes, all meticulously and wonderfully dynamic in their own ways--as are all of the characters you encounter in the game. Every single character is unique and has their own story to tell, their own feelings and struggles, and their own life for the overall Persona experience. Not a single PERSON in this game is flat. And I mean it. The characters in this game are like your real friends, you see them, hang out with them, go to movies with them, get into trouble with them, and so on. You feel for them, and fear for them as well. And as you build your social circle, you understand that that random person sitting on a bench could teach you a real lesson in life. Nearly everyone in this game is important: be sure to talk to as many people as you can!<br /><br />The gameplay: 10/10. As a person who would have told you that turn-based combat is for chumps, I can bravely admit that I was ignorant and borderline stupid to believe that!! The combat is AMAZING. It is quite similar to the other Persona games (I'm playing through P3: FES as we speak) so if you've played the previous ones, you've got a good understanding of how it works. I will say that I have never played P4, so I'm not sure of how similar P4:G is to that one, in terms of gameplay. But there are some differences from P3 to P4:G, and the differences are all MUCH, MUCH better! First off, you can use any of the 4 characters you can equip at a time, or you can use all 4. You can CONTROL your characters. That is a major annoyance in the gameplay of P3: FES; the characters oftentimes make incredibly stupid decisions and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. You don't have that issue in P4:G, you are in control, IF you want to be. (when I fought lesser shadows I'd allow the computer to take over, but I'd control all my teammates when fighting bosses). Everyone has access to your inventory, so if you die, (YOU as in the main character of the game, who is untitled) your teammates can revive you (if you die in P3: FES it's GAME OVER). This allows the fights to go much more smoothly, because using your HUMAN brain you can use bufu (ice) against an enemy that is weak with ice, even if you don't have any Personas or items that have bufu (Use Teddie or Chie!) Another thing, being charmed in Persona is no longer a death sentence (being charmed is literally being CHARMED haha, where the enemy puts sort of a love spell on you and you heal the enemy and attack your teammates. It sucks!!) because you are able to control your teammates, you can give yourself or anyone else an item to &#34;un-charm&#34; them quickly, before you inflict too much damage. This is extremely important and useful because as I said before--being charmed in P3: FES is a death sentence--you actually have to wait until the spell wears off, that is the only way you can be dis-charmed. It is possible to have null-charm too, though.<br /><br />And yes, Persona has it's very own arsenal of terminology for elements and other attacks. Ice (bufu), lightening (zio), fire (agi), wind (garu), and so on all have different names. You will quickly learn those other names, so don't be intimidated by having to learn new words.<br /><br />Shuffle Time is also much better in Persona 4: Golden. Shuffle Time is when you fight the shadows in an awesome way haha, you are rewarded with some random cards. Some cards have Personas, some have other level ups and life and SP (MP in most other games) and so on. Most of the cards are beneficial to you. Shuffle Time is good cause you can choose what card (sometimes cardS) you want, (in P3: FES, the cards are literally shuffled [hence the name] and you gotta recall on your memory to get what you want).<br /><br />There are also assists in P4:G (unsure if they are in the original Persona 4). Because you have 7 fighters to choose from, sometimes randomly a character that you don't have equipped can assist you and knock down enemies or something. It's always very fun and funny! Likewise, your teammates can work together and take down shadows--Chie and Yukiko have an awesome assist together. And your teammates can also do assists separately. My favorite is Chie's, where she literally kicks a random shadow completely off of the field, only to blink as a far distant star, Team Rocket style!<br /><br />The fusion of Personas are simple--you can choose by arcana or level and so on. I usually chose by level, and it was as simple as pie.<br /><br />Other than dungeon crawling (which is a large part of the game) the other gameplay is just as sweet. The dialogue is presented in text boxes and you just push X to &#34;flip the page&#34; kinda. The characters always speak so you can just wait until they finish, or just hit X and read yourself quickly (I loved the voice acting so I didn't mind hearing them talk!) There is third person roaming too, you can roam around your city and also in the dungeons in third person. You can build stuff, fish, read, catch bugs, and so on, all with their own set of controls, but they are all very simple to learn. ALL of the gameplay is simple, and effective.<br /><br />Overall interest: 100/10. This game was like crack--it was so, SO addicting. I love every single microsecond of it too. I haven't played it since (finished it maybe a year or so ago, only now writing the review!) and I'm actually afraid to play it again, in fear that it will swallow my life once more. But, isn't that the best compliment you can give to a video game? Haha! P4:G is a masterpiece, it should go down in history of one of the best games of all times. It is no wonder that it tops the charts of nearly every &#34;Best Vita Games&#34; article you may read, and also no wonder thatit has 5 stars on Amazon. IT. IS. AMAZING. You can feel this game, you can be this game, you can make it your own.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Heck yes, I will! But be warned--and it SHOULD come with a warning label!! It will swallow you whole. And one more word of advice, which may be unclear to someone who hasn't beat the game but THEY should listen closest: pay attention to detail. Nearly EVERYONE you meet is important. ASK QUESTIONS in the game, especially so near the end. There are multiple endings of this game: a good one, a bad one, and the Golden Ending. In order to get the Golden Ending, ASK QUESTIONS.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best darn games I've ever played. Get it.	2015-08-22

I just happen to stumble across this device when I was at a Verizon store.  I use it every day.  I make a lot of business calls via SKYPE and I receive a lot of inbound calls on my cell phone.  This allows me to listen to anything I want to stream on my computer or phone and I can simply turn down the volume on the stream whether it is coming from my phone or computer to receive a call on either SKYPE or my iPhone.  I can also put my call on mute.  The headphones allow you to remove the mike and put in a simple corded mike so that you can take your headphones on the road with you.  My colleagues have all asked me what kind of device I am talking on over skype because it sounds crystal clear.  I wish I had one of these years ago.  And finally... I bought two of these.

Just a confirmation that yes, this game is exactly the same as the Super NES version graphically, and the only difference between the PC/PS version are the addition of cutscenes in the beginning of each of the 8 Maverick hunter stages, as well as longer cutscenes in the beginning and end of the game.  Most of them are forgettable, overly cutesy and appear out of place for those who know the Super NES version very well.  I've never liked cutscenes in Mega Man games to be honest, but using them is the route the series would eventually go.    The other really big change are the remixed theme songs.  They totally messed up Neon Tiger and Tunnel Rhino's themes- they no longer have that heavy adrenaline-rushing punch.  Other themes like Blast Hornet and Toxic Seahorse aren't any better, but they're still decent.  I prefer the heavy rocking music of the Super NES version by a longshot.  Otherwise, this is *exactly* the same game as the Super NES version.  I understand the Super NES version is like 200 bucks now (which is really silly by the way) but that would be the better version to get.  I think there might be a second reason Mega Man X3 on the Super NES is so expensive.  Capcom releasing so few copies is one reason for the price spike of course, but if you've noticed the price really jumped up when that Mega Man X Anniversary collection came out.  Considering that game features the PC/PS version with the remixed theme songs and cutscenes, it's no wonder the Super NES version has become so valuable and expensive.  Bad decision in my opinion to include the PC/PS version on the Anniversary collection.	2015-08-22

Having played Dark Souls first, I figured this would be similar, which I was correct. This feels like a beta version of Dark Souls.The difference between Dark Souls and this game is that instead of  traveling to different areas via pathways, you travel to different areas via portals from the Nexus. the nexus serves as your base of operations, you can stock up on items and take a breather. You enter different worlds via portals. Each world has 2 sub-boses and one main boss. After you complete one world you unlock a series of other world which you can complete at your own pace and order. The lore is good and the story is easier to follow than Dark Souls. Kingdom is invaded by Demons and you take up arms to rid  the world of them. Gameplay is very similar to dark souls but some of the animations different of course. Also you cannot jump but that is a minor limitation. Most of the people here are probably coming from the same situation I did (Having played dark souls first), so in short, if you loved Dark Souls 1, you'll love Demon's Souls. In fact, Demon's Souls is more similar to Dark Souls than Dark Souls 2 is to Dark Souls.	2015-08-22

I have had it for 3 or 4 months now and played it one night then packed it back away in its case. The multiplayer was horrible and buggy. The one thing that never lets you down in any Halo game is it's story so that was the one positive.<br /><br />Back to my second chance for Halo MCC. 343 has done so much work on this game to fix it that it shoukd have never been released in the first place with all the bugs. Multiplayer is finally better. Not perfect but much more bearable. I didn't experience much lag, however I do have a 100mbps connection. I finally enjoyed myself for the first time since Halo 4. There are still improvements that need to be worked on like the match making speeds and map loading. But all in all this is finally starting to look up from when I originally purchased this. Too bad they finally fixed it right before Halo 5 comes out. I look forward to that but hopefully 343 won't make me look like a fool a second time...	2015-08-22

But here I am after 3 different A50s, 2 controllers, and all the patience this veteran gamer could muster,  finally returning my A50s for good today!! From Best Buy, but wanted my fellow Amazon shoppers to know!<br /><br />What Astro got right:<br /> - Incredible Sound Quality<br /> - Good Looking Design<br /> - Flip Up Mute<br /><br />What Astro got SO wrong:<br /> - Awkward placement of master volume<br /> - Chat/Game volume mixer commonly accidentally pushed (ie, against couch cushion)<br /> - Low quality, cheap stand<br /> - Awkward, &#34;tinny&#34;, compressed sounding low quality mic (I'd read this in other people's reviews. TRUST THEM! I began being known as &#34;The Fighter Pilot&#34; in my clan!)<br /> - Only 3 marginally different EQs<br /> - Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service from Astro<br /> - The headset out of nowhere &#34;popping&#34;/crackling/filling with static until my controller gets overwhelmed and disconnects.<br /><br />The last one was the kicker!! I can't have my controller and chat randomly disconnecting!! It is apparently a wide spread issue that when your controllers batteries drop below 75% (give or take) the lowering amount of power sends the headset into crazy static that shut downs the controller/chat briefly. And trust me, it always seemed to happen in the most intense gaming moments!! Exchanged my headset twice at the stores advice that I must have just got a dud. Then on the third one tried to troubleshoot. Astro will suggest that it's YOUR controller (hence the two controllers I mentioned), they'll suggest it's your wifi signal interfering with the headset (disabled router's broadcast and hard wired, to no avail), but the only confirmed work around I found was keeping your controller connected with a plug and play kit while you game. Kind of defeats the purpose of a WIRELESS headset wouldn't you agree? Give it a quick search! I wish I'd known about this headset's disconnecting controller problems before I bought it.<br /><br />Believe me, I wanted to love this headset! The sound quality itself was some of the best I've heard from a headset! And if you're a completely single player gamer who only games for short amounts of time between controller charges, or with their controller always charging, then I'd feel comfortable recommending the A50. But if you love to chat as much as you love good sound quality, and don't want your controller constantly disconnecting, your $$$ is better spent elsewhere. Most expensive does NOT always equal best.<br /><br />I am an XBox One user. I have been a headset wearing, competitive multiplayer, clan leading geek for 14 years :). This was my first and last non Turtle Beach headset ever. Hope this helped!	2015-08-22

I especially like that the controllers click in there so you know it's secure. Once you hear that click you don't have to worry about a thing. There's only one pesky thing though and it's just a minute observation by me, when your controller (s) charge, the light bars glow in like a wave pattern, in and out kinda, which if you're a light sleeper, like myself can be rather irritating. I've had to get up in the middle of the night and throw a t shirt over it to stop the light bars from throwing the light onto my bedroom walls. Other than that, great product, very easy to use, very quick charge, couldn't be more satisfied with it.	2015-08-22

First of the camera is a pain, it will fight you when you are moving it. It is not always clear where to go, and how to get there. It will talk to you saying you need to find such and such item. Which is fine, but it may take you awhile before you figure how to get there. The games combat is okay but nothing to brag about.It is not always clear how to use a new move, which is why when it says it, do not click it before reading it. I did it, and it took me a good 10 or so minutes figure the button combation for one of the moves.<br /><br />Now ot might sound like I hate the game, but I like it. It is just I grew up playing this game. But now when I came back to it, it is just not as good as I remember. The game look good for the time it was made in. The controls are good, the story is wonderful and fellows the book completely. There are quests in this game, while most you have to do there are some silde ones. But these silde quests are all way to easy. It is usually get point a and brong it back to point b. Now it works, it get boring after a few quets of these kind. The game plays like you think a zelda game would play. While it is not as good, it has similar game elements. The thing you will die of the most is falling into a deep pit and dying. The only time the ai is a threat is when you get surrounded.<br /><br />There is a stealth element in the game, and it works for what it trys to do. There is also a picking a lock mini game, while it can be fun at first. It can sometimes be boring doing basically the same thing aging.<br /><br />There are items you can buy, health potions, keys, ex.<br /><br />If you are a fan of these types of games then give it a go, you will probably enjoy it.	2015-08-22

It has something that compelled me to play it multiple times. Uniqueness? Charm? A bold taste in content? New and  clever ways to get the player to manage themselves? But for what it had, it's what it doesn't have that fails it. Integation, weight to action, likable charicters, drive to adventure on. What should be an amazing feat of decision quickly becomes busy work, and its hard to identify with anything that happens in game.<br /><br />But it's not all for a loss. Like I mentioned, it does have some elements that drew me back for more plays than I intended. It has some smart ideas, to be sure, but nothing that can save it.	2015-08-22

Only the sides are protected leaving the rest exposed. But its better protection than without it.<br /><br />Overall I'd get this product if you do not like the current grip on the Wii U Gamepad due to it's glossy finish. It will improve gameplay, but varies from player-to-player. Just don't expect guaranteed protection if you drop your gamepad	2015-08-22

My husband bought these because they work with both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. He uses them wirelessly, and as others have noted the autoshutoff kicks in frequently. I frequently hear the chipper lady saying &#34;Goodbye!&#34; when the headphones power off, followed by &#34;Powering on!&#34; a few moments later after the power button has presses to turn them back on.<br /><br />Did you notice that I said *I* can hear them? Yes, I can, from across the room, because that is how loud the announcements are. You can't turn them off, and you can't even make them quieter.<br /><br />You may also have noticed that I said my husband uses them, but not that I do. That's because I don't. I tried them twice and got so fed up with the shutoff and deafening announcements that I reverted to using the wired headset when I'm gaming.<br /><br />I can't remember what it said, but it also tells you when there's an update available at its customary loud volume. Unexpected surprise!<br /><br />That said, this headset does seem to work well when it's not powering off or screaming at you. I'm told the sound is good and the microphone works. We both still hate this headset, though.	2015-08-22

Sony's PlayStation TV is a great device if you know what you are getting. If you are getting this to use Remote Play from you PlayStation 4 or to play supported PlayStation Vita games, you will not regret this purchase. While it would have made sense for Sony to push the PlayStation TV as a streaming media player as well as micro-console, they did not. While it works with some streaming apps, there are some major omissions such as Netflix, therefore, do not buy this expecting it to replace an Apple TV or Roku even on a secondary TV.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Works with many PlayStation Vita games.<br /> - Remote Play from PlayStation 4.<br /> - Supports DualShock 3 or DualShock 4 controller.<br /> - Very affordable after price reduction.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Not all PlayStation Vita games are supported by PlayStation TV.<br /> - Due to lack of Netflix support among others, this device is a micro-console and nothing more.<br /><br />This is a must have if you want to use you PlayStation 4 in multiple rooms without having to unplug and physically move it. This is also great if you want the ability to play PlayStation Vita exclusives, without having to pay $200. Just be aware not all games are supported.	2015-08-22

You can't jut put a disc in the console and play a game. NO, NO, NO!! You have to install each game you wish to play, and it takes hours to install each one. I found a way to cut the time down, but at the end of the day, you will only have room for about 12 to 16 games. That means you will have to uninstall games after you finish them (if you can solve them) and install new ones, or you have to buy expandable drives or something. 2ndly, updates are poured into this set up almost daily, which take hours to upload into the console, which take time away from actually playing a game(s). The graphics are nice (as I have seen on youtube walkthroughs and other samples on the Internet), but the trade off with respect to time burnt on non related tasking takes away from the aesthetic appeal of this console. It is slick and clean looking and the controller doesn't look too much different from the 360 controllers, so transitioning isn't to much of a stretch. I have been playing games on the XBOX 360 and have to say that at this point, I regret wasting over $300 on this hunk of cr@p.	2015-08-22

I'm really only going to review the product as a whole. Reviewing the game is a bit more subjective, but I can honestly say it's a very fun and challenging game that melds both the Persona 3 and 4 worlds quite well.<br /><br />As the top tier collector's edition for PersonaQ Shadow of the Labyrinth (there was another limited edition that just included the soundtrack and tarot cards I believe), it's well worth the money if you're a fan of the Persona series. Especially for the reduced price it had been going for here on Amazon.<br /><br />-The case is nothing special other than a nicely constructed and firm case with images of the cast as well as screenprints of characters within it.<br />-The soundtrack is really more of a sampler of the music. It would be my main disappointment given how good the music is in this game. It would have been nice to have gotten a full soundtrack for the full price people paid.<br />-A mini artbook introducing you to all the main characters in the game. Nothing major but a nice addition to the package. This is embossed and coated with silicone as well giving it a nice texture.<br />-A set of tarot cards with the creatures featured in the game. These are are actual sized cards not playing card sized and are of good paper stock.<br /><br />All of this is housed in a sturdy box with the game of course. The box itself has some nice embossing and coated with some kind of silicone texture that gives it a nice feel.<br /><br />Overall a really nice addition to any Persona collector and fan.	2015-08-22

It has a story mode	As typical of modern video games, this games had great graphics. It has a story mode, which is lame, however you cannot play the story with the character of your choice, which is a downside. The cutscenes are too frequent and entirely too long. If I wanted to watch a movie, I would buy a Blu Ray or DVD. I also noticed that for every fight you win the 1st round the AI beats you for the second. You cannot block any move and it blocks virtually everything you throw at it. LAME!!! I did not like that it forced me to choose a faction prior to even starting the story mode. I do not want to join a faction. And it did not let me undo it either. Half the moves on the move list you can't even perform and the fighting goes so quickly that you can't even finish the moves before having to try another one. This game could have been much better. $60 for this is an insult. This game is definitely not worth that much money	2015-08-22

Graphics that are lacking for the PS1 era.<br /><br />There is no saving in this game at all. The original PC version, which I own 2 copies of, as well as DOOM 64, DOOM 2, and DOOM 3, all have saving features. Not only that, but the teatures are very gradient, reminiescent of the old 3D Maze screensavers on older Windows machines. The graphics could have been smoothed out a bit more. There are games on the PS1 library that have better graphics, and on the original DOS version of DOOM, there were better graphics.<br /><br />The controls are responsive and fluid, the music is damn awesome, the game comes in a special padded longbox, the gameplay is fun (but repetitive, due to the password system that sucks), and the level design is excellent. There are more postives than neagtives when regardring DOOM on the PS1, but the negatives are major screwups that irritate me. It's a great game, but i recommend not buying this port.

She absolutely HATES the sound of the whistle and the commentary repeating the same phrases every few minutes. As a guy, I don't notice those things and don't care about them at all. As a woman, she can't stand it. Every time I would turn the game on, she would glare at me and roll her eyes. The weird thing is, she likes football more than I do. One day, I asked her what was bothering her about Madden. She informed me that she can't stand the repetitive sounds and that it drives her absolutely crazy. Then I would feel bad playing the game, so I would turn the volume down really low or wait to play when she was doing something where she wouldn't hear the game.<br /><br />When I came home from work one day, I found these headphones sitting on the PS4. Now I can listen to all the whistles and repetitive commentary any day, any time. Forget the product description and all the technical mess littered all over the product reviews. These headphones are baller and they work really well. They're comfortable and the sound stays in your ears and not your wife's. 10/10.	2015-08-22

It's a hardware clone, not an emulator. This means that it is 99% compatible with any GBA carts or accessories that you might have. The only notable exception is the GBA wireless adapter, and that's only because there's nowhere for it to clip on to the console (something that the manufacturer might want to consider looking into).<br /><br />2. Being a hardware clone, it plays titles perfectly with 100% accurate image and sound. The screen's aspect ratio is a little different, so by default it displays a little vertically stretched, but if you don't mind slight black borders you can switch it to native using the hotkeys.<br /><br />3. The screen is backlit and sharp, comparable to the GB Micro (albeit larger) or the AGS-101.<br /><br />4. Battery life is around 4 - 5 hours, depending on your brightness setting. The unit features a rechargeable lith-ion battery and charges via bog-standard mini-USB cable (not micro). A standard USB plug (like the ones supplied with iOS/Android devices or tablets, or something like the Kindle) charges it fine. That means NO PROPRIETARY CABLES (hooray!).<br /><br />5. Yes, you can load ROMS. Yes, it is supplied with the add-on to allow you to do this (the K-Card cartridge). The K-Card requires a micro-USB card (also supplied, a 2GB card) for ROM-loading. I have tested up to 16GB class 10 with no read/write issues. ROMS play no differently to original carts.<br /><br />6. No, it won't play original GB or GBC carts from cartridge, but it WILL play them from ROM. You can load NES ROMs too.<br /><br />This has genuinely become my go-to unit for playing GBA games (in particular Pok&eacute;mon, naturally), especially since my AGS-101 has a faulty screen and my Micro gives me a headache after a while!<br /><br />Not sure if Amazon will allow YouTube links, but I've reviewed the unit over here, if you'd like to see it in action (and compared to genuine GBA hardware): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ITPHdXfsKQou can load NES ROMs too.<br /><br />This has genuinely become my go-to unit for playing GBA games (in particular Pokémon, naturally), especially since my AGS-101 has a faulty screen and my Micro gives me a headache after a while!<br /><br />Not sure if Amazon will allow YouTube links, but I've reviewed the unit over here, if you'd like to see it in action (and compared to genuine GBA hardware): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ITPHdXfsKQ	2015-08-22

War of the Ring, which is a risk like mode. In which you build amies, and your bases. The main goal of the game is to wipe the other factions out, or take there capital region. In this mode once you have a battle you have two options. Real time the battle, which is the one I would say to use, due to uses this option you win usually. Then there is the other option which is auto resolve the battle. In this mode you can build any units, or buildings that you can when you are in the battle. But you cqn not upgrade the units on the map, plus troops you build in the battles will not show up on the map.<br /><br />Now the campaign, there are two campaigns, the evil campaign and the good campaign. In the good campaign you play as the elves, and the dwarfs. In the evil campaign you play as the Orcs, and goblins. There are 8 missions for the good, and bad campaigns. Now there are six factions, but you will not play as the men of the west, or Isgard.<br /><br />Make your own hero is where you can make your own hero. You can play as him in regular maps, but now in the campaign or in the war of the ring mode. The game is z lot of fun, and brings a lot of fun to the rts genre.	2015-08-22

US	554437	R16I7WBRNTPQ72	B00KME8K9C	576599929	Battlefield Hardline	Video Games	1	0	0	N	N	Battlefield : Flatline	There's enough camping to drive you out of your mind.<br /><br />Most of the time, you're dead before you even see your enemy, and the rest of the time, you're dead before you can aim down your sights and start shooting. Then you stare at a loading screen as you wait to spawn, and an annoying beeping noise rings in your ears as you get close to deployment.<br /><br />rarely, i found success at moving in and flanking an opponent, but SMG clip sizes are so small, you can't kill multiple enemies without having to reload first.<br /><br />The respawn timer is incredibly long considering the maps are larger than in call of duty. You spend a long time waiting to spawn, and another long time running to your usually inevitable death.<br /><br />Spawn, Run, Die.<br /><br />rinse, repeat.<br /><br />What's most disappointing, is that when the game works, when the game's fair, it's fun. I love the fair shootouts, where sometimes you die and sometimes you live, but the player who aimed better took the victory. It's that tiny kernel of addictive gameplay kept dragging me back, wasting my time and and angering me over and over again, exploiting my hope that eventually, the game mechanics would quit cheapshotting me. A false hope.<br /><br />There's no reason to play this game in it's current state, and what it takes from you is far more valuable than what you'll get out of it.<br /><br />* also, weapon, attachment, and ability unlocks happen at an extremely slow pace, meaning that you can't pick up the game and breeze through all of the content in a few hours (or minutes, depending on your level of intelligence)<br /><br />You've got to invest a huge amount of time if you want to play and see it all, and since none of it is very good, there's even less justification to even try this game. You can't casually try it and discard it once you've seen everything. You will never see everything, unless you are prepared for a long, abusive relationship.<br /><br />This game's left a bitter taste in my mouth that I've never experienced before. I still think about it, still want it to be worth playing.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest flaw, is that it doesn't do anything to take advantage of the robbery/heist elements in multiplayer. There's no cool maps that involve criminals breaking into a bank as the police try and stop them. It's just battlefield 4 on smaller maps with often worse graphics. It's Painfully uninspired. It feels like it doesn't have a single idea of it's own. Nothing new has been brought to the table. You'd never guess this was a cops vs robbers or cops vs gang game based upon the gameplay.<br /><br />What a miserable and complete failure.r taste in my mouth that I've never experienced before.

Honestly, they dont really seem to notice 2 of the four characters being almost naked, so its not super fan servicey, and  they is a  option to change what they are wearing, so you can just cloth them up if the part is bugging you.

While the material and quality of the protective skin is decent it has a few major flaws that at the end really don't make this an ideal thing to have. First is that the resistance you get with the controller sticks as you get more resistance when you move them around which is annoying to say the least. When you move the controller sticks around the rubberized skin actually pushes back against the motion and thus you have to use a little more force then usual when making the movement not much but still it's a little annoying.The other is that if you're using the headset adapter with your controller this skin protector again gives resistance at that area where there isn't enough of an actual connection for the adapter to work.Another problem is that if you're using a third party controller charging base like Nyko and the like this once again gives resistance to the charging station base where as there isn't enough connection for the station to charge the rechargeable battery in your controller.<br /><br />For the most part it fits the controller relatively well though a little loose at the usb area but not by much.At the end if you don't use the adapter and no third party controller charge station this could work for you but if you do use either of the mentioned products then pass this over.	2015-08-22

I waited almost a full year since the game's release to write this, hoping it'd get better within that time.<br /><br />The game has more stuff, but overall, it hasn't gotten much better at all. Sims 4 feels like it should've been between Sims 1 and Sims 2. Even Sims 1 has a feature Sims 4 lacks. I've heard some dope say this game is more suited for those white liked Sims 2 and not Sims 3, but I've got to disagree with that. I have a huge amount of fun with Sims 2 and Sims 4 does not compare at all to it. It doesn't even come close and I don't it ever will be able to.<br /><br />Sims 4 seems like it's hugely YA-oriented. Much of the game is more about single, young adults partying than anything else. There isn't much available for children to do. A playground consists of only a set of monkey bars and a jungle gym. That's it. Teenagers may as well be adults in high school. That's about the only thing unique to them. Family play is sorely lacking and while the lack of toddlers plays a big part in that, it's also how there's barely anything to make up for it. Parents may as well just be around so kids have people to talk to. I thought infants couldn't get any more restrained when they were bundled up in Sims 3, but Sims 4 confines them to the cradle. They're not bundles anymore, but it doesn't matter. They may as well be since they're stuck in the cradle until the end of their infancy.<br /><br />I got over not having the open world. What I didn't get over is how much they restricted the worlds we did get. Not only are Sims 4's worlds ridiculously tiny (one of which from the expansion pack only has a grand total of FOUR lots available; pitiful), but lots are permanent as they're already set. Lots can't be added, removed, or rotated like in previous games. That might not be so bad if not for the fact the each world only has around 20 lots. Even Sims 2 was capable of having more lots than that in one world. The worlds cannot be edited either, so basically, you're stuck with how they are, whether you like it or not. I'm not even going to get into the world maps, which look like they were designed by a group of first-grade children.<br /><br />Emotions, which were made a very big deal prior to the game's release, have little impact on the gameplay over all. The emotional system is also very easy to manipulate. Really, the emotions are more of an indicator than much else to ensure you know exactly how your sim is feeling at whatever point in time. They have little value.<br /><br />I'm not going to go much into the subject of the graphics. They're not the worst thing about the game, but they make the game look like it was modeled after a preschool cartoon series. That's all I have to say.<br /><br />The only reason I give this game two stars instead of one is there are a few things I like. CAS and build mode are huge improvements, and there are a few little interactions I like that are cute. But Sims 4 has a long way to go before it can stand up to any of its predecessors, and yes, I do mean the base games. I very well remember playing the base games of the previous games and I was far from bored.like it or not.

There are a lot of missions to play and a lot of mobile suits. It was cool to see the 00 raiser and a lot of other modern suits included in the game. My biggest gripe.... Camera angles and it has too much data on the playing screen that blocks your view of the game. Sometimes you end up playing through a small window and the camera views hurt you because sometimes it's to close, then to far, then it blurs out and when you are in a close battle and cant track a boss that's not a good thing. but overall it is still a good game.	2015-08-22

Not only does the game add a feature seen only briefly in the 4th generation games and was debuted in the original special Pokemon Yellow, the Pokemon first in your party follows you around and can interact with the environment, often picking up items that can be used later on.  This game allows for those who were maybe too young when the original second generation came out to relive some memories, after one has finished the first 8 gyms and has completed the Johto region, it is the possible to travel to the Kanto region and relive the original story there.  The game also manages to implement new technology and new areas that were previously unheard of before thus allowing players to connect their games to future generations of Pokemon, the game also adds legendary Pokemon from various other regions, though the Pokedex cannot be completed without cooperation and trading with other players, thus prepetuating the games founding principles of forming bonds.	2015-08-22

I admit I had a lot of skepticism about the new design for Dante and the series in general. After playing however my mind completely changed.

My only complaint is that the controls takes some getting used to. Being so used to playing the DMC games in the past, the new controls took some time to learn, especially switching between weapons (holding down the LB, LR, RB, RL depending on your preferences). That aside, I really like the game and hopefully a sequel will be made!	2015-08-22

If you believe that you will be getting a unit made of the same type of durable plastic that was used in the 1980's, you're going to be let down. If you are expecting it to feel substantial when you handle it like the original NES console did, you're going to be disappointed. The only purpose of this little machine is to allow you to play your NES cartridges. Some of them are not very playable on this unit, for example, I can't get Rad Racer II to give me a nice, clean screen. Paperboy looks a little rough and the sound on Wheel of Fortune is awful.<br /><br />This console did, however, cause me to clean all my cartridges and wiggle them around a LOT in the slot trying to get them to work. So far, I've got 8 out of 9 cartridges to at least play, even with messed up graphics.<br /><br />It feels very light weight, which doesn't bother me as I know electronics have become extremely minimized since the 80's, so don't let that part bother you when you find yourself holding down the unit to pull out the cartridge.<br /><br />Seriously, the issue with this thing is that it is VERY sensitive. VERY! Once I finally get a game to play, a bump on the floor or an accidental tug on the control cable sometimes causes the game to malfunction which is a problem when the kids and I are playing together and our 3 cats and 2 dogs want to be with the family. Just to keep it real, your kids will struggle with getting used to a wired controller so the tugging thing happens more than you'd think.	2015-08-22

Some of the minigames were silly and felt tedious and tacked on though. I mostly got this because I don't have a PS3 anymore, and this came with all the DLC, so why not? The game lags an awful lot despite being a port. It actuallybotherd me a lot how much it lagged considering it's on a much more powerful system than the original. But, if you're a huge DC fan, you should enjoy the game. that's the primary reason I wanted this game. AS a fighting game, it's decent. Not much to say about it from what others already have. Better suited to casuals and just a party game.	2015-08-22

While the material and quality of the protective skin is decent it has a few major flaws that at the end really don't make this an ideal thing to have. First is that the resistance you get with the controller sticks as you get more resistance when you move them around which is annoying to say the least. When you move the controller sticks around the rubberized skin actually pushes back against the motion and thus you have to use a little more force then usual when making the movement not much but still it's a little annoying.If you don't mind having that resistance when you use the controller then this is an alright product for you but if you find it annoying to use more force on your controller sticks like I did then pass this over.	2015-08-22

I had hoped that eventually someone would take a chance and localize the original To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers, in which the cast of the well-known visual novel To Heart 2 found themselves thrust in a dungeon crawling RPG.  That unfortunately never happened, so I was surprised when Atlus announced they'd be localizing its sequel, this game.  In the game, the protagonist Fried is a Libra in training.  Libras are magic users who specialize in sealing away dangerous monsters. Unfortunately they generally don't have much in the way of combat skills, and so to do their job they need to be supported by a party of other characters.  Since Alisia and Melvy, a couple of Fried's friends from the academy happen to be hanging around when the countryside around the royal library is hit with an outbreak of monsters, we have a reason to go dungeon-crawling.  The gameplay is quite similar to games such as [[ASIN:B000IOM45C Etrian Odyssey - Nintendo DS]] and [[ASIN:B001Q933P8 Class of Heroes - Sony PSP]].  The royal library serves as a home base where the characters can recuperate when not exploring.  In an interesting little twist, the characters can rest for free at the library, so there are no worries about spending all the proceeds of a dungeon exploration on healing at an inn.  As the game progresses, Fried will meet plenty of new allies; each of his new allies has a basic class (fighter, magic user, maid, etc.), but as the characters level up, they can branch out into more advanced versions of that basic class.  And of course, the game's hook is that most of the monsters encountered in the dungeons are standard RPG beasts (ghosts, werewolves, etc.) anthropomorphized as moe anime-style characters.  The bosses (or &#34;mutants&#34;) are styled in the same way, and generally after beating the boss the player is treated to a visual-novel type scene where the boss' clothes have been shredded or the boss is depicted in a highly suggestive manner.  Considering this game's visual novel origins, this shouldn't be too surprising, but be advised there will be some pretty suggestive stuff lurking.  I'm not sure the &#34;M&#34; rating is warranted, but neither is that rating totally out of line.  That said, you might expect a light and fluffy game where outside of the cutscenes and moe characters, there's not much underneath.  However, there's a pretty deep and challenging RPG modulo all of the fan-pandering.  While the first dungeon is not much of a challenge, after that point there is a difficulty spike and the game is not afraid to punish the player if they wander into a encounter unprepared. The player will no doubt find themselves scrambling out of the dungeon with a decimated party from time to time, and being underleveled during a boss fight can easily culminate in a game over. Fortunately, a little bit of grinding for an extra level or two will usually equalize the playing field.  So overall, this game ended up being exactly what I was looking for-a solid RPG with some nice anime style eye candy.  The character and monster designs are very attractive, there's a solid and challenging game, and each character class has a pretty wide range of skills which can be leveled up as the player desires.  That said, there are a few definite flaws in the game as well.  The highly-suggestive nature of some of the cutscenes and some of the monster designs may put off some players, most of the characters are pretty stock archetypes (Fried could have stepped out of the lead role of a harem anime, and Alisia is a standard &#34;old friend&#34; of the protagonist for example), and the mapping system leaves a bit to be desired.  Some of the dungeon maps are quite large, and there are two map views available.  Unfortunately, the large area of some of the dungeons means that when the map is zoomed-out, the player could find themselves squinting and straining to see how to navigate from point A to B while the zoomed-in map doesn't give an adequate overall view of the layout.  Additionally, the map marks the location of treasures, but it would have been nice to be able to mark certain points on the map to visit later (to make a note of a boss location for example).  Overall, however, if you like dungeon crawlers and cute anime girls, this is probably a Vita title you should consider acquiring.	2015-08-22

Adaptability comes in the form of dozens of tweakable gameplay options, new Story and Classic modes, difficulty levels, and even optional DLC if so inclined. One can indulge in the harder difficulty and manual mapping of dungeons that the series became famous for or take a more relaxed approach with lower difficulty and auto-mapping.<br /><br />Much effort has been expended in creating a new Story mode for this revisiting of the older EO2 (as was done in the first EO Untold). Note that this series has always had a basic storyline, but the new Untold variants add another layer to them with predefined characters (versus blank slates in Classic), solid voice acting, and a new dungeon.  EO2 Untold pulls ahead of the earlier Untold game by having a more intuitive Grimoire system and a pleasant restaurant side-game that allows one to decipher recipes for stat boosts. The Grimoire system remains a random system of earning transferrable character and enemy skills for customization, but has been smartly simplified.<br /><br />The story and characters themselves are very entertaining, especially the duo of Bertrand and Chloe. Fortunately, there are multiple save slots available to revisit story points easily or keep separate files for both Story and Classic playthroughs.	2015-08-22

Novice Joystick players don't be intimidated by this game. I play Nascar Racing 2003 Season in Simulation mode and I found it to be about the same challenge level as compared to Nascar Racing 2002 Season in Arcade mode. Interestingly I tried playing it in Arcade mode but found Simulation easier! The action is more smooth and less frantic.<br /><br />For those who wan't a quick Arcade style race and don't want to sit thru an entire lengthy race with pit stops you can easily do so. You can enjoy this game without a Racing (Steering) Wheel set up. I use a gamepad with a Joystick where you have to use a &#34;tap pump&#34; action during fine tune turning. You must hold down the joystick all the way on most sweeping turns. I set up for a Quick race at the minimum 5% Race Length, Simulation Mode, Full 42 opponents, 74 to 75% Opponent Strength, Damage Level None. (Leave adaptive speed control off)  This lets you race from the back of the field to the front. On a couple tracks you end up in front halfway thru which gets kind of boring, but most others you must work for a top 5. You may wan't to tweak steering assistance to 15 percent or more. I have no problems spinning out or keeping control of the car when nudging into the back or side of opponents. I was surprised how easy it is to control the car in Simulation with a gamepad which has rough choppy steering and acceleration.<br /><br />I'm running the game on a Windows 7 64 bit system with a low end NVidia GeForce GT 220 Graphics Card. Everything loaded and plays fine. I have all the Graphics options turned up all the way and there is no lag and it looks great.	2015-08-22

If you want just the regular version (one disc, not two) than get it used for a good deal, but if you want the collector's edition than get it new so you have a fair chance of getting the complete package.	2015-08-22

US	28848211	R3OMRAI00QQT9N	B00KVR4HEC	558590596	Bloodborne	Video Games	5	2	3	N	Y	A game worth persevering through	"I just can't get over how much this game has left it's mark on me. The plot and story (while not shoved in your face) is one of the most unnerving and engrossing subjects I've ever encountered. SOOoo worth the struggle to complete! Also, if you get stuck..or can't seem to get the hang of things....don't shy away from video walkthroughs and online tips. Sometimes, all it takes is seeing how another player handles things for the gameplay to just \\\"click\\\\\". This is also a game where I would HIGHLY suggest buying the strategy guide as well - only because I would have missed a lot of the optional areas/bosses if I hadn't.<br /><br />As for the actual review...I consider myself an average gamer. I enjoy my RPG's and open world games immensely: things like Skyrim, Shadow of the Colossus, Uncharted, and such. I love artistic and beautiful worlds with gameplay and story to match. Therefore, I was a bit hesitant when I bought this game since I knew who the developer was. Dark Souls and Demon Souls just did not click with me. I probably poured several hours into both titles and just didn't enjoy any of it. I know I'm the black sheep in that regard - just take a look at the horde of Souls fans..<br /><br />When I first started Bloodborne (hesitant but determined), I was immediately drawn in by the environment. It took me a long time to explore each area because of constant pauses spent observing intricately modeled statues, architectural pieces, and atmospheric effects. Not to mention the gorgeous lighting and sound effects/soundtrack. As for actual gameplay, it took me a VERY long time to get the hang of combat. It was very fast paced, which initially made me panic and run away from everything. Not the best way to practice, but it is what it is. I fought the first boss on the bridge and managed to kill him without dying. Then I got to the actual \\\\\"Official\\\\\" first boss and s*** hit the fan. I was dying and losing blood echoes/blood vials over and over and was forced to re-run the whole level just to restock my supplies. This area of the game had me almost give up and quit (I'm so thankful I didn't, but I can completely understand why others would). If there are people who are hesitant to buy this game,I won't sugar coat it. The first several hours are probably going to be brutal if you're not used to this type of difficulty/gameplay. It's so true what others have said though! When you FINALLY reach that moment of breakthrough and start mastering your chosen weapon and get the hang of dodging and evading, the game simply gets addictive. I cherish my Hunter's Axe for saving my ass time and again. Also...DON'T FORGET ABOUT BLOOD GEMS!! If you ignore that mechanic, your weapon will be a shadow of what it could be. Even when you reach this point though...danger is always around you, and if you become too over-confident, you'll more than likely have a couple of screaming fits when you get taken down over and over for rushing through things. This game challenges you to stay calm and collected, yet simultaneously wants you to think fast and react with precision. When you preserver and reach this point, you really get a complete thrill while playing. I ended up exploring every nerve-wracking nook and cranny. I defeated every boss in the game and got the true ending. After the credits were done, I immediately started my next playthrough on NG+ and didn't stop playing until I had beaten it again. It's that addictive.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying this game, maybe try and rent or borrow it from a friend - just to try it. Honestly though, it's worth every penny as this game has some of the highest replay value of any title I've played. Do yourself a favor and get immersed in this dark, gritty, Lovecraftian s***-fest and enjoy every minute (even if you do end up breaking your controller at some point). &lt;--- on that note, elevator shafts are evil so don't blindly run around or you'll be like me: \\\\\"splat\\\\\", \\\\\"scream\\\\\", \\\\\"repeat\\\\\"... >.&lt;to restock my supplies.

US	854335	RQ8R2CEX0R9DC	B00RHI62N2	526662438	J Stars VS+ - Parent	Video Games	3	1	2	N	Y	Good as a party game	A decent game. Good as a party game, but if you get it for multiplayer, a fair warning. You only start with 6 characters. You have to unlock the rest. Huge roster, but you gotta unlock nearly all of them. They way you unlock them is freakin' retarded. You have to earn points to purchase, which seems pretty normal, BUT you also have to unlock a character slot, and to do that, you have to level up your &#34;Friendship&#34; gauge. I honestly don't get why if you have purchase them with points, you still need to meet other requirements.<br />Story mode is... It say there are 4 different stories, but they are exactly the same. Events, fights, plot. Exactly the same. You just play as different characters, but he assist characters are exactly the same regardless.<br />Gameplay wise, it's pretty fun once you get the hang of it. Pretty sporadic and wild until you get used to it. If you're familiar with the Tenkaichi DBZ games, you should pick it up quick. One neat thing is that powering up works different for a lot of the characters. For example, with Goku, and Kenshiro, you just hold R1 and X, and they charge until you let go, but with someone like Hiei, he instantly goes up a whole bar by taking off the bandana over his third eye, and then he powers up the same as Goku, until he puts the bandana back on. And then you got characters like Gintoki,who once he starts, even if you're not holding it anymore, he keeps going until his phrase is done, same wit Ichigo. Difference is Ichigo has that hollow mask as soon has he's done his phrase.<br />Good game for weaboos. Not so good for people just looking for a fighting game. I mainly got it because it was a chance to have characters from DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Fist o the North Star all in the same game. That being said, I know next to nothing about more than half the roster. If you're big into anime/manga, you may enjoy it much more than me.	2015-08-22

I was concerned because some of the reviews were negative.  The whole thing looks really stretched out to me in the pictures but it's actually really cool looking in person. The buttons don't squeak (someone made a big deal about that). The stick has a nice &#34;broken in&#34; feel.  There's enough room on the platform for your left hand and your right hand rests on the beveled edge.  I only played for an hour, and it was comfortable enough not to concern myself with thinking about it! There's mats on the bottom of it of a foamy material.  should help anchor to a table.<br /><br />Play tests:<br />- SF2 (PC) roundhouse wouldn't map correctly, could be specific to my set up.  I didn't get hung up on it though, as I was just play testing punch latency and specials.  Everything was acceptable. Light punches came out at the same timing from the stick as the keyboard.  If there's a PC latency I couldn't see it in that play test. Tested Ken, fireballs were tight, Tetsumaki combos came out easy, shoryuken on reaction. Negative edge stuff was seamless.  I'm a little rusty on SF but it seemed really good for the PC.<br /><br />- Pac-Man (PC, PS3 (namco museum))  I didn't overshoot any turns, played for 10 minutes or so.  Stick worked fine.<br /><br />- Capcom vs SNK 2 (PS3 - but it's the PS2 version)  works great. I played the computer but the matches went well.  I nailed combos, was able to operate on reaction, spacing was fine for me. Blanka, Honda, Ken - able to do supers without compromise.  Play seemed unhindered.<br /><br />- Tekken Revolution - no problem in practice mode.  Was able to nail Paul's sways/ punch sways (df+1 b...). Just frame was fine. everything seemed on point.  Online matches were a different story!  The stick has no control over lag ;)<br /><br />I really thought about spending the extra bucks for the madkatz stick.  I have the SF4 stick for 360 and like  it.  So far, I would put the RAP4 on that level of quality, just different design (different buttons, different stick feel, good heft but less mass overall).  I saved $50 over the current madkatz models and got a great stick.  If, after heavy play I learn something important, I'll update the review.	2015-08-22

I've never played any Far Cry games before, and I'm not a fan of first person shooters, but Far Cry 3 turned out to be a surprisingly super fun game for me. The story was great and I enjoyed the single player campaign a lot (I did not try to do multiplayer, considering this game has been out so long, I wasn't sure how many people still play the multiplayer). The stealth component of the game was SUPER fun. You can sneak up to people's back and do Take Outs, or you can simply set up shop somewhere far, and take out enemies one by one with a sniper rifle. I'm playing Assassin's Creed Rogue after I finished Far Cry 3, and I was surprised to feel that I felt much more stealthy in Far Cry 3 than I do in AC:Rogue (but I've only just started).	2015-08-22

When it wants to, it works great! It plays all my games just like the original NES. The only problem with that is that it only does that when it wants to.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sometimes when I plug in my original NES controllers, they don't work. The D-pad is totally dysfunctional, and it confuses the A BUTTON for the START BUTTON!<br /><br />2. It's too small and light. Me and my brother will be playing on it and if one of us pulls on the controller by accident, the thing will fall down and mess up the<br />game, which leads to my next complaint.<br /><br />3. It's made very cheaply. It is only 15-20 bucks so I'll cut it slack for that.<br /><br />4. It doesn't work with any of my flat screens. I might be doing something wrong though. I don't know it just doesn't work.	2015-08-22

When playing The Black Ops 3 Beta and using the &#34;Awareness&#34; perk you can definitely tell which way they are coming as from left to right. But with the Astros you didn't have to try to tell you just knew.<br /><br />Another cavet of these is that they are only comfortable for a few hours. They do get tight as when you go to take them off after a few hours you will definitely go &#34;whew&#34;, your head will be pleased. But also your ears will be wet. The leather on the ear cups doesn't allow for air to get through so you Will sweat.<br /><br />Overall a pretty decent headset for the price.	2015-08-22

I just wanted to comment that while this is a PS3 game ported to the PS4 system, it seems one of your better, more worthwhile ports in terms of graphics quality.  Unlike some PS3 to PS4 game ports that I've played, namely The Last of Us, the upgrade in graphics quality doesn't feel as much like you're still playing a PS3 game.  The video is more stable and seems rendered at higher resolution, making the game feel almost new again, or at least not a huge step back, if you've already acclimated to the better experience of the PS4.  Don't set your expectations too high, as this definitely isn't as visually impressive as the best the PS4 has to offer.  But, unlike The Last of Us, I wasn't disappointed with the game visually.  It also seems to take advantage of some other next generation perks too, like loading speeds, if my memory is true.<br /><br />As for the game, I've played all of the AC games to date, and completed all but the very first.  I've never been fond of the franchises story, but the gameplay is fantastic and the story can virtually be ignored when focused on the quests, especially after the single-player campaign has completed and you're left to roam the open seas in search of plunder and buried treasure.  And if you're in Pirates of the Caribbean withdraw, while waiting for the next sequel or if you like the concept of playing an open world game as a romanticized old-world pirate, this is the best I've come across.	2015-08-22

Upgraded from 360 because of Madden, Gears, Doom, etc. titles in the near future. Love the Xbox One design. Looks much less like a 80's vcr in real life than it does in pictures.

When using this with a Sony PS3 controller, the Afterglow controller needed to be charged half as much as the battery life is much longer.  They are very sturdy as I've accidentally dropped one of them twice onto hardwood floors and it is still working.  The feedback is solid and I think it's a great buy for the money.

Dragon Age II is the best game in the series. It's better than Origins and Inquisition. Don't get me wrong, I liked Origins and Inquisition, but neither of them are as good as Dragon Age II.<br /><br />What makes Dragon Age II unique is that the player character isn't trying to save the world. They're trying to protect themselves and the people they care about, and they don't always succeed. It does a good job demonstrating that sometimes loss is inevitable; sometimes people can't be saved, from circumstances or from themselves. It also does a good job portraying characters realistically; their personalities and opinions are complex and influenced by their unique circumstances, and aren't necessarily always good or strong.<br /><br />I could talk about Dragon Age II and its extraordinary characters forever. Beyond that, the quests are very interesting; the combat is fun and fast paced (and can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties); the graphics are very good for a game its age, and the sound track is absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />This game made me feel in ways other games couldn't. My words can't do it justice. I really recommend experiencing it for yourself.	2015-08-22

US	7362950	R12YF9TW8LCLRU	B00CX9T598	572129152	Destiny	Video Games	3	0	0	N	N	What a disappointment.	Destiny is one of those games that just didn't live up to the hype. Being a Bungie game, it's already going to have alot of hype around it. The trailers, screenshot, teasers, even the fact that Paul McCartney worked with Marty O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori to make the soundtrack spawned alot of hype. But the game came out, and alot of people were dissapointed (including me). It's visually very impressive, beautiful graphics, dynamic skyboxes, cool level and character design, and neat weapons. It feels like Halo, but with more common FPS mechanics added in. The core of the game is really fun, but there's little to no content, besides DLC. The campaign (again, without DLC) will probably take you under 3 hours to beat, depending on skill level. Every other mission, your AI helper, your Ghost, he examines a computer, tries to gain access, and trips the alarm, and then from there, it becomes survival, defending him from wave after wave of enemies.The only story is found in these collectibles called &#34;Grimoire cards&#34; that tell bits of the lore. Gameplay is really, REALLY fun, but there isnt enough content to really enjoy it. But, besides the campaign, there are these Patrol missions on each planet, where you just run around for however long, finding and killing enemies and doing little missions. Anyone who plays this game (like me) will play for 6 hours at a time, then complain about it.	2015-08-22

No character ever felt like a transparent set of dialogue trees, and each interacted like multi-faceted human beings. The combat was a main concern of mine since I struggled mightily with The Witcher 2, but it turned out to be a major strength in this game. It's a huge improvement over it's predecessor and allows for satisfying sword/sign combos. And sweet Freya is there a lot of content. Everywhere you look there are quests to be done, monsters to be slain. I was a'feared I'd never finish it. But I did and I easily topped 100 hours doing so. While it's true that there can be some performance hiccups, it never rose to be anything more that an idle annoyance. Honestly, I can't recommend this game enough for anyone even remotely interested in a single player adventure game.	2015-08-22

I'm an avid ps4 user, and having the cooling fans is definitely a plus for me since I literally fall asleep listening to something on the system for 3 hours. Having the 4 usb hubs is definitely a plus for me since I use an Afterglow headset which permanently used up a usb hub on the ps4 and now having 3 others is great, as far as charging the ps4 controllers, the only thing I can say about it is that the setup was a great idea, but there's no real way to check of the controllers are fully charged since the ps4 controller LED indicates the charging status of the controller, and with them being plugged in upside down and the LED is now not visible to check if the controller is fully charged or not. I know it doesn't take long to charge them, but seeing the bright blue indicated is a must for people like myself that plug things in and don't check them often if there fully charged or not... other than that, I've never been a big fan of having my systems stand on the side for the sake of my for example, bumping into my entertainment center and tipping it over and have something possibly break or something happen to a disk that maybe in it, but when the ps4 is in the pocket standing upright, to me it seems pretty secure. not sure what the DC port is on the front of the stand since there isn't a clear indication as to what it is for or atleast details I may have missed while looking it over.	2015-08-22

The disc arrived promptly and in good condition. My problem was the game. I thought it was a sequel to xcom enemy unknown, but it was almost the same game with only a slight difference.

Voices dubbed out-of-sink (only re-done voices available in game 3), slowdown in the third game. I really appreciate that I could play any of the series on Ps3 at all. All of the cinemas were messed up and unwatchable in the second game. The graphics and definition stood out clearer in the game itself and also too, if you're PS3 was online at all the update it makes you get takes away your system's ability to play any PS2 titles, and probably PS3's made after the update was made. I used to play the older games on my PS3 from May 2012 until I went online and the rep said now  it cannot be repaired and must be replaced to play all of the collectible games.	2015-08-22

I played the original Tecmo Bowl for years and it was my favorite football video game of all time. Better than even the most current Madden games!! As crazy as that sounds, I go with the old school. And yes, only half the teams were assessable. Remember back in 89, there were 28 NFL teams and only 14 were put on the console. Plus they didn't have the rights to use the actual mascots on the helmets. But they used real NFL rosters from the 1988 season. A quick DBZ reference, if  Tecmo Bowl is a Saiyan, then Tecmo Super Bowl is a Super Saiyan. Everything you wanted in the original was put into TSB.  I know its a corny reference and that would mean all the million of football games that came out after TSB, would blow it out of the water or be at Super Saiyan 50!! I disagree . I think it tops them all. It's so fun and addicting.  And maybe it helps that I grew up watching the NFL and particularly this group of players. Emmitt, Montana, J. Rice, LT, R.Lott, B Sanders, Marino, Elway!! The list goes on and on but these are some of the greatest players in the games history. I can't stop playing it and it is almost 30 years old!! Just love this game. Hopefully DBZ fans would agree with me. Haha.	2015-08-22
