## ApproxCountDistinct
    Compute approximated count distinct with [HyperLogLogPlusPlus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog#HLL++)
## ApproxQuantile
    Approximate quantile analyzer. 
    The Quantile is the a value, for which it holds true, that exaclty x percent of the total values are smaller than the quantile.
    x can be passed to the analyzer as parameter, x has to be a Number between 0 and 1. Choosing 0.5 will yield the median.
    The allowed relative error compared to the exact quantile can be configured with `relativeError` parameter. A `relativeError` = 0.0 would yield the exact quantile while increasing the computational load.
