## ApproxCountDistinct
    Compute approximated count distinct with [HyperLogLogPlusPlus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog#HLL++)
## ApproxQuantile
    Approximate quantile analyzer. 
    Yields the x-quantile; a value, for which it holds true, that exaclty x percent of the total values are smaller than the yielded value.
    The quantile x can be passed to the analyzer as parameter, x has to be a number between 0 and 1. Choosing 0.5 will yield the median.
    The allowed relative error compared to the exact quantile can be configured with `relativeError` parameter. A `relativeError` = 0.0 would yield the exact quantile while increasing the computational load.
## ApproxQuantiles
    The same as ApproxQuantile, can be given a sequence of quantiles.
## Completeness
    Completeness is the fraction of the number of non-null values devided by the number of all values in a column.
## Compliance
    Compliance is a measure of the fraction of rows that complies with the given column constraint.
    E.g if the constraint is "att1>3" and data frame has 5 rows with att1 column value greater than
    3 and 10 rows under 3; a DoubleMetric would be returned with 0.33 value
## Correlation
    Computes the [pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) between the two given columns.
    It has a value between -1 and +1, where +1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and âˆ’1 is total negative linear correlation.
## CountDistinct
    Number of distinct values in the column.
## DataType
    Yields a distribution map, including the overall number of values of each datatype and the percentage of each datatype. 
    Possible datatypes are Boolean, Fractional, Integral, Unknown and String.
## Distinctness
    Distinctness is the fraction of the number of distinct values devided by the number of all values of a column. Can be given a sequence of columns.
## Entropy
## Histogram
## Maximum
    Returns the largest value in the given column. Works only for numerical columns. Only for numeric columns.
## Mean
    This is the average over all values of the given column. Therefore it is the fraction of the Sum and the Size of the column. Only for numeric columns.
## Median
    Returns the value in the middle of the given column. This is more robust against outliers than the mean. It is equal to the 2-quantile.
## Minimum
    Returns the smallest value in the given column. Only for numeric columns.
## Mode
    This is the most common value in the given column.
## MutualInformation
    It measures how much having information about one column reveals about aonther. If both columns are independent, the mutual information is zero. If one of the columns determines all values of the other column and the other way around, there is a functional dependency between the columns. In that case, the mutual information is equal to either of both columns' Entropy.
    Formally it is the nested sum of all values of both column and then for each pair: p(x,y)log(p(x,y)/p(x)p(y))
## PatternMatch
    Gives the fraction of values that match a certain regex constraint divided by all values in the given column.
## Size
    Is the amount of values in the given column.
## StandardDeviation
    Quantifies the amount of variation of the values in the given column. A low standard deviation means that the values are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation means that they are spread out over a large value range. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance.
## Sum
    The sum of all values in the given column. Only for numeric columns.
## UniqueValueRatio
    The quotient of all unique values divided by all distinct columns of the given column. The unique values only appear once in the column. The distinct values are all different values in the column where every value is counted once.
## Uniqueness
    Gives the fraction of values of the given column that only appear once in the whole column divided by the Size of the column.
