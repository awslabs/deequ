## StandardDeviation
    Quantifies the amount of variation of the values in the given column. A low standard deviation means that the values are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation means that they are spread out over a large value range. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance.
## Sum
    The sum of all values in the given column.
## UniqueValueRatio
    The quotient of all unique values divided by all distinct columns of the given column. The unique values only appear once in the column. The distinct values are all different values in the column where every value is counted once.
## Uniqueness
    Gives the fraction of values of the given column that only appear once in the whole column divided by the Size of the column.
